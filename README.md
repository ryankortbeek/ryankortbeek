# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About me
I am a 4th-year software engineering student at the University of Alberta. I'm passionate about software and interested in learning more about ML and AI. I have experience writing code for PCL Construction, Huawei Technologies Canada, AlbertaSat, and UABiomed. I also enjoy golf, windsurfing, skiing, and a bit of cooking here and there.

## Currently working on...
- A simulator for the human-friendly exoskeleton currently being designed and prototyped by [UABiomed](http://www.uabiomed.ca)
- Some backend dev for the [AlbertaSat](http://albertasat.ca) Ex-Alta 2 website
