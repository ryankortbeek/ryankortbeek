# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About me
I am a Computer Software Engineering student at the University of Alberta in the final year of my bachelorâ€™s degree. I am passionate about problem solving, learning, and gaining experience as a Software Engineer. I have experience developing software for PCL Construction, Huawei Technologies, AlbertaSat, and UABiomed. Aside from coding, some of my favourite things to do include windsurfing, golfing, skiing, and hiking.

## Currently working on...
- A simulator for the human-friendly exoskeleton currently being designed and prototyped by [UABiomed](https://github.com/ualbertabiomed)
- Developing the [AlbertaSat](https://github.com/AlbertaSat) Ex-Alta 2 ground station
