# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About me
I am a 4th-year software engineering student at the University of Alberta interested in the many applications of software, ML, and AI - especially in the areas of spacecraft, healthcare, finance, and robotics. I have experience writing code for Huawei Technologies Canada, AlbertaSat, and UABiomed. Some of my hobbies include golf, windsurfing, skiing, and I also enjoy cooking and reading.

## Currently working on...
- A simulator for the human-friendly exoskeleton currently being designed and prototyped by [UABiomed](http://www.uabiomed.ca)
- Further integrating the Live Telecommands terminal on the [AlbertaSat](http://albertasat.ca) Ex-Alta 2 website to our ground station
- A personal website
- School :)
